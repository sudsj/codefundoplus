# Rescue Map
Idea: 
I want to create an app that allows rescue authorities and people in need of help find each other better during natural disasters.

I see that there are a lot of helpline numbers being circulate during natural disasters but I think there is not much co-ordination between agencies and thus a lot of people who are in real need of help are Unseen by the relief agencies. 

The idea is to create a common website/app that helps users mark their location co-ordinates on a map that's pre-downloaded into their phone specific to their region. Then they can indicate what kind/s of help they need eg. Need Food, Need Clean Water, Medical Emergencies, Need Pickup to Safer/higher locations, Only Woman/Man, Old age people stuck etc.

Now all the authorities can view this common information that is shared to them via the website/app and they can act based on the kind of help needed. This eliminates the need of sharing location info between authorities as this is the primary goal of this app.
